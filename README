How to generate the zip folder: 

Step 1: Rename PDF with roll number (Skip if pdfs are already named as per the roll number)

	1. Run GetBoundaries.py
	(GetBoundaries.py: input -> click on top-left and bottom-right of the rectangle box you want. Output: boundaries of the box in the format: x,y,w,h where (x,y) are coordinates of top-left)

    2. Select top left and bottom right of the roll number which student has written, to get x,y,w,h coordinates of the roll number

    3. Copy the output (coordinates) and update it in ExtractRollNumberTROCR.py (x,y,w,h)

    4. Adjust input folder (where all the scanned pdfs are present) and output folder (where you want to store the pdfs which are renamed as per roll number) paths in ExtractRollNumberTROCR.py

    5. Run ExtractRollNumberTROCR.py

    6. Verify if all the pdfs are named right.


Step 2: Extract Question wise images
	1. Run GetBoundaries.py 
	(GetBoundaries.py: input -> click on top-left and bottom-right of the rectangle box you want. Output: boundaries of the box in the format: x,y,w,h where (x,y) are coordinates of top-left)

	2. Note down the boundary coordinates for each question and update it in GetQuestionWiseAnswers.py 
	Follow this example to store boundaries for each question: 
		Example : 
			question_boundaries = {
				1: {   # Page 1
					1: {   # Question 1 with subquestions
						1: (0, 925, 2480, 1140),
						2: (0, 1960, 2480, 490),
						3: (0, 2370, 2480, 1106),
					},
					2: (0, 120, 2480, 800)  # Question 2 without subquestions
				},
				2: {   # Page 2
					3: (0, 0, 2480, 3506)
				}
			}

	3. Adjust question to page mapping.
	Example: 


	4. Adjust input folder (where pdfs are stored as per roll number) and output folder (where you want to store the images required for manual grading) paths in GetImageAndCSV.py

	5. Run GetImageAndCSV.py
	(Output: )

	6. Zip the folder with csv file inside it
